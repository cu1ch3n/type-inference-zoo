features:
  - icon: 🕹️
    title: Interactive Playground
    details: Try out type inference examples and explore various algorithms directly in the browser. Hands-on experience made simple.
  - icon: 🧩
    title: Unified Syntax and Implmentation
    details: A consistent syntax across multiple type inference algorithms—no need to waste time building new parsers or pretty printers.
  - icon: 👩‍💻
    title: Friendly to Language Implementers
    details: Code is probably less ambiguous than the notation used in the paper and more approachable.
