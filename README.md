# Type Inference Zoo

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

Welcome to **Type Inference Zoo**! This project is dedicated to implementing a variety of type inference algorithms. It serves as a personal project, as I am trying to understand the type inference algorithms well by implmenting them. Considering that it might be helpful for those who are also exploring type inference algoreithms, I am glad to make them avaliable online.

ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ There are indeed animals (implementations) in the zoo, not just references to animals.

A static online web demo is coming soon!

## Get Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and build the project using stack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cu1ch3n/type-inference-zoo.git
cd type-inference-zoo
stack build
stack exec type-inference-zoo-exe -- "let id = \x. x in (id 1, id True)" --alg W
```
